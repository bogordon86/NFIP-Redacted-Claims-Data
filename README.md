# NFIP-Redacted-Claims-Data
Working in R with NFIP Redacted Claims Data

## To start, you will need to go to FEMA's website and search for their OPENFEMA datasets
## or you can click the link below:
## https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/fima-nfip-redacted-claims

## You can download the full dataset as a CSV or you can also ping FEMA's API

## For this exercise, I downloaded the CSV and loaded it into R
